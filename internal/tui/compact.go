// a pass is an LLM call now, so it must not block the update loop. When the
// evicted middle is too small to plausibly land the conversation under the
// threshold, the pass skips the summarizer and masks what little old turns
// hold instead — see evictionCanLandUnder/maskOnlyPass in compact_light.go.
//
// The pass is two-stage and tiered, the way the research on long-running
// agents lands. The summarization stage runs first, on its own goroutine,
// against the raw evicted middle — it must read the actual tool output and
// decisions, not the mask's placeholders, so the summary can preserve exactly
// what compaction would otherwise discard. The mask stage is the fallback: if
// there is no backend, or the summary call fails, or comes back empty, the UI
// thread masks the oversized tool results and thinking blocks in the evicted
// middle as a cheap headroom lever. Either way a pass never hands a model more
// context than it started with, and only the newest share of messages is kept
// verbatim in both stages.
