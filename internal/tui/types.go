// named, the same reason Config embeds Discovery in config.go: every field

// text, and none of them is ever read without the others nearby.

//
// spin is built with no style of its own and has to stay that way. The status

// a style here would emit its own reset in the middle of that span and drop
// the colour from everything after the spinner — see working().
