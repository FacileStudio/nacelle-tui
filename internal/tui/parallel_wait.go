// this is the other half — the model must not keep working a turn whose
// results it cannot read, because a detached fan-out's outcomes stream to
// PostDetached and never back to its stream. Cancelling closes the stream,
// settle runs, and the prompt returns to ready while the spinner rows keep
// ticking under it.
