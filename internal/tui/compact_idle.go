// a run that needs the freed context, and this compacts after a turn that grew
// too big — beginning no run, because the pass reports through
// settleCompaction, which starts nothing while the model is idle.
//
// It only fires when nothing is queued, so it cannot race a run about to
// start: deliver hands any queued line to send, whose own pre-flight CountTokens
// check handles the same context. While the pass runs the update loop waits on
// it exactly as the send path does, so a message typed meanwhile is queued, not

// reclaimed at a natural break rather than waiting to overshoot. A pass is an
// LLM call, so it must not race a live run — the command only fires while
// idle, and while the pass runs the reader's next keystroke queues behind it
// (ask treats an in-flight pass like busy). A fresh manual pass clears any
