# nacelle-tui — Configuration

Every field the core `Config` reads, then the client's own settings layer — a separate thing,
with its own precedence order — and the traps in each.

## `nacelle.Config`

The core reads nothing from the environment or from disk. Every field is passed in the struct
literal a consumer builds.

| Field | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Backend` | — required | The model this agent runs on. No default: a package that picks one for you is a package that hides the most consequential decision in the configuration |
| `System` | — required | The system prompt. Empty is refused rather than defaulted — an agent with no system prompt is a general-purpose assistant wearing a product's name |
| `Thinking.Effort` | the backend's own default | `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. `none` is the only value that asks for no reasoning, and a model whose reasoning is mandatory answers it with a 400 rather than ignoring it (measured on `stealth/ox-alpha`, 2026-08-23). Empty hands the decision to the provider, which on a model whose reasoning is mandatory means that model's own maximum. Not validated against the model: OpenRouter clamps a level a model does not advertise rather than refusing it |
| `Thinking.Budget` | `0` (no ceiling from here) | Reasoning-token ceiling for one turn. The other spelling of `Effort`. Anthropic takes both at once; OpenRouter answers the pair with a 400 (`Only one of reasoning.effort and reasoning.max_tokens can be specified`, measured 2026-08-23) and its backend resolves that by letting the budget win, since the gateway defines each level as a percentage of the budget anyway. Refused at construction when it cannot work: at or above `MaxTokens` it leaves the turn nothing to answer with, and below a backend's `Capabilities.MinBudget` (1024 on `anthropic`) the API rejects it |
| `Thinking.Show` | `false` | Stream the model's reasoning as `KindThinking`. Off by default, matching the APIs: the raw chain of thought is never returned and a readable summary is opt-in. It changes what a consumer is shown and nothing else. The reasoning always travels back over the wire, because that is what the tool loop replays to keep the model's train of thought intact across a tool call |
| `MaxTokens` | `DefaultMaxTokens` (32000) | Per-turn output ceiling. Generous on purpose — every request is streamed, so a large ceiling costs nothing in latency, while a small one truncates an answer mid-sentence and buys a retry |
| `MaxIterations` | `0` (no cap) | How many times the model may be asked. A cap is only safe when every tool is read-only and cheap; reaching it ends the run with `Stop: StopIterations`, not a failure |
| `Tools` | `nil` | Tools the model may call in this process |
| `MCP` | `nil` | MCP servers the model may call tools on. Only `anthropic` can reach them — see [architecture.md](architecture.md#capabilities) |
| `Logger` | `slog.Default()` | Receives the few things worth recording that are not events — retry attempts, mainly |

`Backend`, `Thinking` and `MCP` are all checked against the chosen backend's
`Capabilities` at construction; a config asking for something the backend cannot do is refused
with an `*Unsupported` error rather than silently running with less.

## `anthropic.Config`

| Field | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Client` | built from the environment | Set to share a client, point at a proxy, or hand a test a stub transport |
| `Model` | `DefaultModel` (`claude-opus-5`) | — |

## `openrouter.Config`

| Field | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `APIKey` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | — |
| `Model` | — required | An OpenRouter model slug, e.g. `anthropic/claude-opus-5`. Required: OpenRouter fronts hundreds of models and a default would be this package choosing the one thing the caller came here to choose |
| `BaseURL` | `DefaultBaseURL` | Point at a compatible gateway or a recording proxy in tests |
| `Referer`, `Title` | — | Attribution only — `HTTP-Referer` and `X-OpenRouter-Title`. Neither affects the answer; without `Referer` the usage simply does not appear against an app |
| `Provider` | `nil` | OpenRouter's provider-routing object, passed through untouched. Worth setting `require_parameters: true` when tool calling matters — it keeps the request away from providers that would drop the tool schema |
| `Options` | `nil` | Extra request options for the underlying client |

## `tools.Config`

| Field | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Root` | — required | The directory every tool is confined to, through `os.Root` |
| `AllowBash` | `false` | Mounts the command tool. Not a limit that can be tuned into safety — running commands is either something this agent may do or it is not |
| `CommandEnv` | `PATH` + `HOME` only | The process environment is never inherited — it is where a service keeps the credentials a model must not read |
| `CommandTimeout` | `DefaultCommandTimeout` (2 min) | A command outliving it is killed with its children |
| `MaxOutputBytes` | `DefaultMaxOutputBytes` (64 KiB) | Caps what one tool call may return — output stays in the context window for the rest of the conversation |
| `MaxReadBytes` | `DefaultMaxReadBytes` (48 KiB) | Caps a single file read, below the output cap so a read that hit the limit still leaves room for the notice saying so |

## The TUI's settings layer

The client's settings layer is a separate settings problem from the core, and deliberately does not share a
mechanism with it: **the library must never read configuration from disk or environment.** A
`nacelle` package that read `~/.nacelle.yml` would let a file on a *different* machine's disk
change a headless consumer's behaviour, the way Bubble Tea's own config never reaches past the
program that imports it.

### Precedence

**Flag beats environment beats file beats default**, resolved in one function
(`settings()` in `config.go`) and nowhere else. The suite has already paid for the
alternative once: a CLI that read its environment inside one code branch and its file inside
another turned what its README called "overrides" into two mutually exclusive modes nobody
could tell apart.

| Layer | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Flags | `-backend`, `-model`, `-effort`, `-root`, `-system`, `-bash`, `-thinking`, `-mycelium`, `-project-context`, `-skills`, `-trust-skills`, `-skill-dir`, `-mcp`, `-approve-tools`, `-max-iterations` | Only flags actually **typed** are collected, via `flag.Visit` — Go's `flag` package cannot otherwise tell a flag left alone from one passed its own default value. `-skill-dir` and `-mcp` are repeatable (`-mcp a.json -mcp b.json`); every other flag keeps only its last occurrence |
| Environment | `NACELLE_BACKEND`, `NACELLE_MODEL`, `NACELLE_EFFORT`, `NACELLE_REASONING_BUDGET`, `NACELLE_ROOT`, `NACELLE_SYSTEM`, `NACELLE_BASH`, `NACELLE_THINKING`, `NACELLE_MYCELIUM`, `NACELLE_PROJECT_CONTEXT`, `NACELLE_SKILLS`, `NACELLE_TRUST_SKILLS`, `NACELLE_SKILL_DIRS`, `NACELLE_APPROVE_TOOLS`, `NACELLE_MAX_ITERATIONS`, `NACELLE_SEARCH`, `NACELLE_FETCH` | A misspelt boolean (`NACELLE_BASH=yez`) is treated as unmentioned, not as `false`, and falls through to the layer below. `NACELLE_SKILL_DIRS` is colon-separated, the same convention `PATH` itself uses for a list of directories |
| File | `~/.nacelle.yml` | Preferences only, **no credentials** — those already have two homes: the environment, and the Anthropic SDK's own profile. `KnownFields(true)`: an unrecognised key (`max_iteration:`, one letter short) is refused rather than silently ignored |
| Defaults | — | `backend: anthropic`, `root: .`, `bash: false`, `thinking: false`, `mycelium: true`, `project_context: true`, `skills: true`, `trust_skills: false`, `skill_dirs: []`, `mcp: []`, `approve_tools: false`, `max_iterations: 40`, `search: ""` (no web search), `fetch: true` |

`mycelium`, `project_context` and `skills` default **on**, unlike `bash`: each fails soft to
nothing when there is nothing to find — no `mycelium` on `PATH`, no `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`
anywhere above `root`, no `~/.agents/skills/` — so a machine without any of them is no worse
off for asking. `trust_skills` and `approve_tools` both default **off**, and for the same
underlying reason: a project's own `.agents/skills/` can carry instructions to run arbitrary
scripts, and asking before every tool call is a decision that changes how the client feels to
use — blanket-trusting a directory, or blanket-interrupting every call, are both decisions only
the person running this should opt into, not defaults sprung on them. See
[Context, skills and mycelium tools](#context-skills-and-mycelium-tools) and
[Tool approval](#tool-approval) below.

### `~/.nacelle.yml`

```yaml
backend: anthropic
model: claude-opus-5
effort: high
reasoning_budget: 8192
root: .
system: You are a terminal coding assistant.
bash: true
thinking: true
mycelium: true
project_context: true
skills: true
trust_skills: false
skill_dirs:
  - ~/.claude/skills
mcp:
  - ~/.claude/.mcp.json
approve_tools: false
max_iterations: 40
search: https://searx.example
fetch: true
```

Every field is optional. A missing file is not an error — most people never write one — but an
unreadable or malformed one is: a config silently ignored is worse than no config, because the
setting carefully written is simply not in effect and nothing says so.

**No per-project `./.nacelle.yml` yet.** A second precedence layer before the first has real
users is a layer nobody has asked for the shape of.

## Context, skills and mycelium tools

Four things the TUI adds beyond flags and the model's own tools, all client-side, none of them
in the core `nacelle` package — the same "the library must never read configuration from disk"
rule above applies to these too, not only to settings.

**This session's own facts** (always on, `environment.go`). Prepended to whatever `System`
says, before context and skills, because it is the most general layer and the only one with no
switch: the absolute working directory, that the file and search tools are confined to it and
strip a leading `/` rather than refusing it, today's date, that the answer is rendered as
markdown, and whether anyone reviews a tool call before it runs. Two clauses are conditional the
way the banner's own lines are — the `run_command` path exception and the paragraph naming
irreversible commands appear only under `-bash`, because explaining a tool the model was not
given teaches it to skim the rest. These are facts the model cannot recover from any tool schema.
Advice about *which* tool to reach for is deliberately not here; it lives in the tool
descriptions, where it travels with the tool that needs it and costs nothing when that tool is
not mounted.

The persona above it (`defaultSystem`, `main.go`) is the one layer `-system` replaces
outright, and it stays deliberately short. Codex ships two prompts for one harness — 6.6&nbsp;KB
for the models post-trained on it, 24&nbsp;KB for general GPT-5 — so prompt size mostly measures
how much the model was *not* trained on your harness, and Claude is well inside the trained case
for this shape of tool. What it carries is only what a terminal changes about answering: brevity,
paths rather than pasted source, and not claiming something works unchecked.

**Project and global context** (`-project-context`, `context.go`). Every `CLAUDE.md` and
`AGENTS.md` found walking up from `-root` to the filesystem root, plus `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` —
the [AGENTS.md standard](https://agentsstandard.com)'s own global-base path, also read by
Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini and pi (at its own equivalent, `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`) — all
appended to the system prompt, most general first. A user's own `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` is
deliberately **not** read: it assumes Claude Code's own tools, hooks and slash commands, where
an `AGENTS.md` at the standard's own path is written, by the convention's premise, to make
sense to whichever agent finds it. None of this is trust-gated — see
[architecture.md](architecture.md) for why a plain instruction file and a skill are not the
same risk.

**Skills** (`-skills`, `-trust-skills`, `-skill-dir`, `skills.go`), following the
[Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification): every `SKILL.md` under
`~/.agents/skills/` (no trust needed, the user's own machine), every one under a **trusted**
`.agents/skills/` found the same way the context walk works, and every one under a directory
named by `-skill-dir` (repeatable), `NACELLE_SKILL_DIRS` (colon-separated) or `skill_dirs` in
`~/.nacelle.yml`. Only a skill's `name` and `description` ever reach the system prompt; the
model reads the rest with `read_file` once it decides a skill applies. `-trust-skills` trusts
every project-local `.agents/skills/` found on that run and remembers the decision in
`~/.nacelle/trust.json`, keyed by canonical directory — run it once per project, not on every
launch.

**MCP servers** (`-mcp`, `mcp.go`). Each `-mcp` names a file in the `mcpServers` format —
`.mcp.json` and its siblings — whose servers are started at launch, their tools handed to the
model like any other. It reads the file other clients already write, so pointing at
`~/.claude/.mcp.json` works without copying anything, which is the same problem `-skill-dir`
solves for skills. Both stdio (`command`) and HTTP (`"type": "http"`) servers work, on **either
backend**: the tools are bridged to `nacelle.Tool`, so `-approve-tools` gates them like every
other tool and `-backend openrouter` gets them too. `${VAR}` and `${VAR:-default}` expand, so a
token stays in the environment rather than in the file.

The flag is repeatable and `mcp:` in `~/.nacelle.yml` **accumulates** with it rather than being
replaced — the one list here that does. `client.Load` merges files by server name with the later
one winning, so a personal list plus a project's layer the way every client in this ecosystem
layers its own scopes. Replacing would mean naming one project server silently switching off the
nine already configured.

A server that will not start **ends the run**, which is the opposite of how skills and project
context fail. Those are discovered, so finding nothing is indistinguishable from there being
nothing to find; this was asked for by name, and a tool that is quietly missing reads as a model
refusing to work rather than as a server that is down.

Nothing is discovered. A `.mcp.json` sitting in the working directory is **not** read, because it
names executables to run — strictly worse than the project-local `.agents/skills/` this client
already gates behind `~/.nacelle/trust.json`, since a skill is text the model may decline to act
on and this is a subprocess started before the model is asked anything. Every server nacelle
opens was named on the command line or in your own `~/.nacelle.yml`.

The spec defines the `SKILL.md` file, not where it has to live on disk — every tool picks its
own directory (Claude Code reads `~/.claude/skills/`, pi reads `~/.agents/skills/` and its own
`~/.pi/agent/skills/`), so `~/.agents/skills/` is nacelle's own choice, not a location any other
tool already reads. `-skill-dir` is how nacelle sees a directory that belongs to one of those,
without moving or copying anything into its own — the same problem pi itself solves with a
`skills` array in `settings.json` pointed at `~/.claude/skills` or `~/.codex/skills`. No trust
gate applies to it, same reasoning as `~/.agents/skills/` above: naming a directory here is
something only the person running nacelle, on their own machine, can do in the first place.

**Mycelium tools** (`-mycelium`, `tools.Mycelium`, [api.md](api.md#tools)). `list_flows`, `run_flow`
and `search_memory`, when the `mycelium` binary is on `PATH`. Narrower and more legible than
reaching the same commands through `run_command`, and available even with `-bash=false`.

**The banner** (`main.go`'s `banner`) is how much of this is actually visible before typing
anything: line one names the backend and model, line two the resolved `-root`, how many skills
loaded (from every source above, combined), how many `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` files did, and
whether bash is on. Nothing on it is decorative — each answers a real "is that actually on"
question this client otherwise had no way to check short of a debug build.

`bash off` earns its place because the symptom arrives from the model rather than from this
client: asked to build and run something, it answers that it has no terminal and cannot run a
command. That is true and deliberate — `run_command` is unconfined, so it stays opt-in — but
nothing connected that answer back to a `bash: false` written once in `~/.nacelle.yml` and
forgotten. Turn it on with `-bash`, `NACELLE_BASH=1`, or `bash: true`.

## Web search

`search:` (`NACELLE_SEARCH`, `-search`) is the base URL of a [SearXNG](https://docs.searxng.org)
instance to search the web through. **Empty by default, and there is no instance this client
could pick on your behalf** — nacelle is public, so any default would send your queries to
somebody else's machine and leave them in that operator's logs. Empty means the tool is not
mounted at all: the model is never told search exists, and nothing fails.

It is a URL rather than a toggle plus a URL, so two settings cannot disagree about whether
search is on. The banner says `search on` when one is set, and says nothing when none is —
unlike `bash off`, which is named either way, because search being off has no symptom to
explain.

```yaml
search: https://searx.example
```

Passing `-search ""` (or `NACELLE_SEARCH=`) turns search off for one run without editing the
file, which is why this setting is a pointer internally while the other strings are not: for
everything else empty means "not mentioned", and here it means "not this run".

An endpoint that could never work — no scheme, no host — stops the client at startup rather
than quietly leaving the tool unmounted, because search silently missing looks exactly like a
model that decided not to search, and nothing on screen would connect that to a typo here.

Three failures are named rather than left to read as an outage: an instance answering HTML
means `json` is missing from `search.formats` in its `settings.yml` (off by default in
SearXNG); a 403 is usually its limiter; a 404 usually means this was set to the `/search` page
copied from a browser rather than the instance's base URL.

Why an instance you host rather than the backends' own search: both have it, and neither is
free — $10 per 1,000 searches on Anthropic, no free tier on OpenRouter. A local tool also works
identically on both backends, where server-side search would be wired, and billed, per backend.

## Reading a page

`fetch:` (`NACELLE_FETCH`, `-fetch`) lets the model read one web page by URL. **On by default**,
unlike bash and unlike search, and it is what makes a search result more than a sentence — search
answers with a title and two lines, and this reads the page behind them.

It is on by default because it cannot change anything and cannot reach anything but the public
internet: loopback, private ranges, the cloud metadata endpoint and the special-use ranges are
refused in the dialer, on every redirect hop. Pages come back as text — headings, lists, code
blocks, and links resolved to absolute URLs so the model can follow one by calling the tool
again. `text/markdown` is asked for first, which Cloudflare and Vercel answer by converting at
the edge for roughly 80% fewer tokens.

Turn it off with `fetch: false` for the one risk the guard cannot cover: a fetched page is
written by a stranger and read by the model as instructions, so it can ask for another URL with
something from the conversation in its query string. With `bash: true` that channel already
exists through `run_command`; with bash off, this is the only one. The banner says `fetch off`
when it is off, since a model that cannot read a page it just found needs the reason on screen.

Sites do refuse automated clients. This one identifies itself honestly rather than impersonating
a browser — every current source agrees that negotiated access is what gets an agent through and
that a spoofed user agent is what gets an address banned — so a 403 from an anti-bot layer is
reported as one, with the suggestion to try another source, rather than as the page not existing.

## Tool approval

`-approve-tools` (`NACELLE_APPROVE_TOOLS`, `approve_tools`) asks before every tool call runs.
**Off by default**: a nil `Config.Approve` means the SDK itself runs every call unasked, and
the TUI's own default matches — nobody gets a behaviour change without opting in.

When on, a call blocks in the status line on `y` (allow this one call), `a` (allow this tool
for the rest of the session — remembered in memory only, never written to disk, unlike
`-trust-skills`) or `n` (deny; asked again next time). Asks are serialized to one question at
a time, because a backend can run several tool calls concurrently within a turn and this
client has exactly one place to show a question. A pending question is answered or abandoned
by the same ctrl+c/ctrl+\ that already gets a wedged run's way out — both wait on the run's
own cancellable context, so cancelling one unblocks the other with no separate mechanism.

A denial is reported on `ToolEvent.Refused`, not as a tool failure — the SDK converts it into
a normal tool-result error block for the model to see, the same as any other failed call.

## Slash commands

Typing `/` at the start of a line names one of the client's own commands instead of a
question:

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/clear` | Reset the transcript, the conversation sent to the model, and the running cost total. Same client, new session. Never starts a run. |
| `/help` | List the commands above and the keybindings (esc, ctrl+c/ctrl+\). Never starts a run. |
| `/quit` | Quit. Never starts a run. |
| `/skill:name [what to do]` | Run a loaded skill directly — **does** start a run, unlike the three above. |

An unrecognised command or skill (a typo like `/clera`, or a `/skill:name` that names nothing
loaded) is reported back rather than sent to the model as a literal question — the same
trade-off every peer client with slash commands makes, on the same reasoning: a real question is
far less likely to start with a slash than a mistyped command is.

`/skill:name` sends that skill's own `SKILL.md` content as the question, instead of waiting for
the model to decide on its own that the skill applies and read it with `read_file` — the same
shortcut pi's own `/skill:name` offers, for the same reason: "models don't always" make that
call themselves. Anything typed after the name is appended as `User: <that text>`, the same
convention pi uses, so `/skill:pdf-tools extract the tables` tells the skill what to do with
itself rather than only that it applies. Every loaded skill counts, from `~/.agents/skills/`,
a trusted project `.agents/skills/`, or a `-skill-dir` — one namespace, `skill:`, so a skill
named `clear` or `help` can never collide with the three commands above.

Typing `/` alone opens a dropdown listing every command and skill, each skill with its own
description; more typed narrows it, ranked best match first — a prefix beats a plain substring
beats a fuzzy, order-preserving scatter of the same letters, so `/skill:rev` finds `review`,
`facile-review` **and** `hunk-review`, not only a name that starts with what was typed. While
it's open, `up`/`down` move the selection instead of scrolling the transcript, `tab`/`enter` fill
the prompt with the highlighted entry (plus a trailing space, and without submitting — most
useful with `/skill:name`'s own trailing argument) and `esc` closes it, leaving what was typed
alone. A second, ordinary `enter` is what actually sends it.

### The prompt

The prompt wraps and grows as you type, up to ten rows, then scrolls inside itself. Every row it
gains is a row the transcript gives up, and gets back the moment the question is sent. `alt+enter`
(or `ctrl+j`) starts a new line without sending; `enter` always sends.

It used to be a single-line input, which scrolled sideways instead of wrapping — a question wider
than the terminal slid out of view a character at a time and read as though it were typing over
itself.

`up`/`down` belong to the prompt at every height — there is no transcript here to scroll, so
nothing competes for them and a wrapped question is editable whatever size it has grown to.

### Scrolling

The client renders inline, on the terminal's own screen, so scrolling is the
terminal's job — wheel, scrollbar, `tmux` copy-mode, your terminal's search, all of it, on the
whole session rather than on a window this client owns. There are no scroll keys here because
there is nothing here to scroll.

That is a deliberate reversal. It ran on the alternate screen once, which hands a program a
blank page with no scrollback of its own, so the client had to own scrolling: capture the wheel,
which takes click-drag selection with it, leave copy-mode reaching nothing, and un-draw the whole
session on quit. Those arrived as four separate complaints and were one decision. Giving the page
back answers all of them, and costs one thing — a printed line belongs to the terminal, so a
resize reflows it the terminal's way rather than this client's, and a theme change applies from
then on rather than retroactively.

### While a run is going

The status line spins for as long as the run lasts, and names what it is waiting on — `waiting for
a response` before the model answers, `running read_file` between a tool's call and its result,
`running 3 tools` when the backend runs a turn's tools at once. It is on the one row that is
always drawn, so it stays visible while scrolled back through the transcript.

This replaced a spinner that only covered the gap before the first event. Every gap after it — a
tool running, the model called again with its result — left the screen still, and a client that has
stopped moving reads exactly like one that has stopped working.

**Enter still works while a run is going**: the line is queued, shown above the prompt, and sent
once the run finishes. A queued `/help` is still a command.

**`esc` stops the run**, and that is all it ever does. `ctrl+c` stops one too, but it is also the
key that quits an idle client, so the press that abandons an answer is a press that has to be
thought about first; `esc` is the one that never is. Either way the queue goes with the run rather
than being started by it, and the client says how many it dropped — the alternative is a message
that silently never gets asked. Idle, `esc` does nothing at all, and with the `/` dropdown open it
closes that first: one visible thing per press.

The question is on the screen before either of them is worth pressing. It used to appear only when
the answer did: the client printed what it had said only after running what that message started,
and what a question starts is a wait on the model. The prompt emptied and nothing else happened,
which reads as a client that swallowed it. The `⏺` line naming a tool had the same fault and was
worse for it — it waited on the tool it was announcing, so a six-second command was announced six
seconds late. The CHANGELOG carries the measurements.

### Quitting

`ctrl+c` when nothing is running, `ctrl+\` at any time, and `/quit` all end the session, and the
session simply stays where it is. Nothing is printed on the way out and nothing needs to be: what
was said went into the terminal's scrollback as it happened, so quitting leaves it exactly as
running left it.

That used to need a deliberate dump at exit, because the alternate screen hands the old page back
untouched and quitting un-drew the whole conversation. Inline rendering removed the problem rather
than the workaround.
