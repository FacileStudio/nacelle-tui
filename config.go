// zero, which is the whole difficulty of a precedence chain: "false" and "not
// mentioned" are different answers and a bool cannot tell them apart.
//
// It holds no credentials, deliberately. They already have two homes — the
// environment, and the Anthropic SDK's own profile — and a file with a key in
// it is a file that can never be committed to a dotfiles repo, which is the
// only reason to want one of these on two machines.

	// third setting joined them, so `effort:` and `thinking:` are already
	// written at the top level of every ~/.nacelle.yml that mentions them.
	// load() decodes with KnownFields, which means a key that quietly
	// relocated under a heading would not be a warning on the next launch,
	// it would be a refusal to start. The tag is what keeps both keys
	// exactly where they were, and config.Effort and config.Thinking still
	// resolve, so no call site moved either.
	Reasoning `yaml:",inline"`

	// Web is embedded rather than named, so every field on it is still
	// reached as config.Search, for the reason Discovery is: it keeps this
	// struct's own field count from growing every time the list does.

	Web `yaml:",inline"`

	// Discovery is embedded rather than named so every field on it is still
	// reached as config.Mycelium, not config.Discovery.Mycelium — the grouping
	// exists only to keep this struct's own field count from growing by one
	// every time that list does, not to change how anything reads it.
	// yaml:",inline" is load-bearing for the same reason on the file side:
	// every key stays at ~/.nacelle.yml's top level, exactly where it was
	// before this existed.
	Discovery `yaml:",inline"`

	// Sources is embedded, and inlined, for both of the reasons just

	// under a key nobody has.

	// layer's hooks are more hooks, not replacements.

// Toggles is the on/off settings: whether the model may run commands, whether
// a human is asked before tools run, and whether file edits are drawn as
// diffs. One field per key, all pointers, for the reason Config's own doc
// comment gives.

	// Diffs draws what an editing tool did to a file as a git-style diff
	// under its one-line report. Purely a display choice, which is why it
	// defaults on where Bash defaults off: it costs nothing when nothing
	// edited a file, and `diffs: false` restores the bare one-line
	// rendering.
	Diffs *bool `yaml:"diffs"`

// defaults is the bottom layer, and the only one that answers everything.
//
// Mycelium, ProjectContext and Skills default on, unlike Bash: all three fail
// soft with nothing to show for it when there is nothing to find — no
// mycelium on PATH, no CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md anywhere above Root, no
// ~/.agents/skills/ — so a machine without any of them is no worse off for
// asking, and a machine with them gets the benefit without a flag to
// discover first.
//
// TrustSkills and ApproveTools default off, and neither is the reasoning
// above. Loading skills found globally or already trusted is one thing; a
// project's own .agents/skills/ can carry instructions to run arbitrary
// scripts, and blanket-trusting whatever a directory happens to contain is a
// decision only the person running this should make, not a default.
// ApproveTools is off for a plainer reason: every tool this client has ever
// run, it has run unasked, and a gate that started asking by default would
// change that for everyone who never asked for one. Most consumers of an
// agent loop — a script, a CI job, someone who trusts the model to just get
// on with it — have nobody to ask and want none of this; the interactive
// human who does is the one who turns it on.
//
// Budget defaults to zero, which is the one answer here that really is "say
// nothing": no reasoning ceiling is set from this side and the backend applies
// whatever it applies. It is still filled in rather than left nil, because
// this is the layer that answers everything and every deref above it depends
// on that being true.
