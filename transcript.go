// copy-mode. See View for why that is worth more than owning them.

// of order is not a transcript. Joining them first makes the whole batch one
// message, which insertAbove writes in one go.
//
// One message, but not necessarily one Println — see printed, which cuts a
// batch taller than the window has room for into pieces that still arrive in

// behaves this way, including the shell the client was launched from.

// streaming is what a run has produced but not finished: the reasoning and

//
// It is tailed to the rows the window can spare rather than shown whole. The
// live region is repainted on every delta, so it has to fit on the screen —
// an answer longer than the terminal cannot be redrawn in place at all, and
// trying is how an inline program corrupts its own output. What scrolls off
// the top is not lost: the whole answer is printed, rendered, the moment it
// finishes.
//
// Both are drawn plainly, not as markdown. Half a fenced code block is not a
// document, and a parser run over the answer again on every arriving
// character is a cost this pays once, at the end, instead.
//
// It stamps the moment reasoning started on its way past. Drawing is not where
// a clock belongs, but this is the only thing that runs after every absorbed
// delta and lives in a file this may write to — absorb itself is in view.go.
// The frame is drawn after every message, so the stamp lands one frame after
// the first thinking delta, which is under a millisecond on a figure printed
// to a tenth of a second. See stamp.
