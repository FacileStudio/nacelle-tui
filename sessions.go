// sessionLog is the record of a session on disk: one JSONL file per run,
// under ~/.nacelle/sessions/, holding the questions that were typed and the
// answers that came back.
//
// It holds a path and nothing else — no handle, no buffer, no goroutine. Each
// line is an open, an append and a close, which costs a syscall per line and
// buys the property that matters here: the file on disk is complete after
// every line, so a session killed with ctrl+c, a crashed terminal or a laptop
// closing lid leaves a readable transcript rather than a truncated one. A
// transcript that only survives a clean exit is a transcript you cannot rely
// on, and the write rate is one line per thing a human said or read.
//
// A nil sessionLog records nothing and every method tolerates it. That is the
// state a machine gets when the directory or the file could not be opened —
// a read-only home, a full disk, no resolvable HOME. say() calls line() on
// every transcript line without checking, deliberately: the alternative is a
// nil test at the one call site that runs most, guarding a feature that is
// beside the point of the program.

// sessionHeader is the first line of the file, and the only place the run's
// own identity is written. Readers keyed on "v" can tell a v1 file from
// whatever replaces it without parsing the body, which is what a version
// field is for; the rest is what you need to make sense of the lines below
// it and is not repeated on any of them.

	Started string `json:"started"`
	Backend string `json:"backend"`
	Model   string `json:"model"`
	Root    string `json:"root"`
}

// sessionEntry is one recorded line. Text and the tool pair are exclusive —
// a question or an answer carries text, a finished tool carries a name and a
// duration — and both halves are omitempty so a tool entry has no empty
// "text" key inviting a reader to look for content that was never collected.

// newSessionLog opens this run's transcript, or returns nil if it cannot.
//
// The directory is 0700 and the file 0600 because of what is in it: the
// questions a person typed at a work machine and what a model answered. Those
// are not world-readable on a shared host, and a mode set after the fact
// leaves a window where they were.
//
// The name is a timestamp plus the pid. The pid is what keeps two clients
// started in the same second from appending into one file: the stamp has
// second resolution, and two shells launched from one command is a normal
// thing to do rather than a rare race.
//
// The stamp is UTC and carries no punctuation, which is two deliberate
// departures from RFC3339. Local time sorts wrong: the offset changes at every
// DST boundary and on every flight, so a directory named in local time is not
// in chronological order however it looks, and sorting the names is the only
// index this has. And RFC3339 spells the offset with a colon, which is a
// character Windows refuses outright, SMB shares refuse for the same reason,
// and the Finder renders as a slash.
//
// The header is written here rather than lazily on the first line, so an
// abandoned session still leaves a file saying what it was going to be. A
// session where nobody typed anything is a fact worth having; a zero-length
// file is not.

// over a private key, or a diff touching a .env would put a secret in a file
// that outlives the session and that nobody remembers is there. Filtering it
// out afterwards means writing it first, which is exactly the moment the
// damage is done; the only reliable redaction is never collecting it.
