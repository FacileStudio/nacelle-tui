// localTools opens the file/search/command tools and, when asked, adds the
// web ones — the caller owns closing the returned Set.
//
// The two internet tools are built together in webTools, which is also where
// the reason WebSearch's error goes back unwrapped is written down.
//
// Every failure after tools.New succeeds closes the Set on the way out.
// Without that it is dropped on the floor: the caller's own defer only ever
// sees the nil this returns on an error, so the *os.Root behind it — a real
// descriptor — outlives the only reference to it. The process exits moments
// later today and nothing notices, which is the kind of leak that becomes
// real the first time something rebuilds a tool set without restarting.
//
// The handle is held in a plain local rather than in the returned one, and
// that is load-bearing rather than style. A named result is assigned by the
// return statement *before* any deferred function runs, so with the Set named
// there, `return nil, nil, err` had already overwritten it — the deferred
// close then panicked on a nil receiver instead of releasing anything. The
// error paths still hand the caller nil, which is what it wants; only the
// closing needs a name the returns cannot reach.

// the subagent tool itself, so anything localTools returns is inherited by a
// delegate whether that makes sense or not. The plan is drawn above the prompt
// on the one screen there is; a delegate calling this would replace what the
// parent wrote, and nothing afterwards puts it back.
//
// So it goes on after withSubagents has taken its copy. Same set, one line
// later, and the delegate never sees it.
