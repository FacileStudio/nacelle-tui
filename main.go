// Command nacelle is a terminal client for a nacelle agent.
//
// It exists to be the SDK's first consumer. A terminal exercises every event
// kind a backend can produce — text, reasoning, a tool starting, a tool
// finishing, why a turn ended, what it cost — which is more of the contract
// than a headless caller touches, and it does so while someone is watching.
//
// It is deliberately small. Sessions, profiles, themes and panes are what a
// product grows; none of them tests the API, and the point of this one is to
// find out where the API is annoying before three consumers depend on it.

// defaultSystem is who the model is and how it answers — the one layer

// It stays this short on purpose. Codex ships two prompts for one harness —
// 6.6KB for the models post-trained on it, 24KB for general GPT-5 — and the
// extra seventeen kilobytes is autonomy, planning and answer-formatting that
// the tuned model already knew. Claude is that tuned model for this shape of
// tool, so the ceiling here is closer to pi's ~600 characters than to
// anyone's twenty. What is here is only what a terminal changes about
// answering. Be brief, because the transcript competes with the live region
// for rows. Prefer a path over pasted source, because a dumped file scrolls
// the answer off the screen. And do not claim a thing works unchecked, which
// is the one failure a person cannot catch by reading the reply.
const defaultSystem = `You are a terminal coding assistant. Read before you write, keep edits small, and say what you changed.

Answer as briefly as the question allows, and lead with the result rather than the reasoning that reached it. Refer to code by path and line instead of pasting it back — the person asking has the file open, and a transcript full of quoted source scrolls the answer out of view. Do not say something works until you have checked that it does; where you could not check, say so.`
