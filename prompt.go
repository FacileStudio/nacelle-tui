// promptRows is how tall the prompt is allowed to grow before it scrolls

// The prompt wraps and grows rather than scrolling sideways, which is what a
// single-line input did: a question longer than the terminal is wide slid out
// of view a character at a time and appeared to type over itself. Growing has
// to stop somewhere, though — every row it takes is a row of transcript, and
// a prompt free to fill the window would answer one complaint by creating a
// worse one.

//
// promptRows alone is a ceiling, not a guarantee: ten rows of prompt in an
// eight-row pane draws twelve rows into eight, and what falls off the bottom
// is the prompt itself — the reader ends up typing into something they cannot
// see. Half of what remains after the fixed chrome — the blank row above the
// two-row status bar and the margin before the prompt — keeps the transcript
// and the prompt both real at any size, and never returns less than the one
// row a prompt has to have.

// It is a textarea rather than a single-line input for one reason, and it is
// the whole feature: a text input scrolls sideways and a textarea wraps.
// DynamicHeight is what makes it grow, and it counts visual rows, so a long
// question with no newlines in it still earns the rows it needs.
//
// Enter is not bound here. It reaches key() first and sends, which is what
// this client has always done and what every peer harness does — so the
// newline that a textarea would normally spend enter on moves to alt+enter,
// with ctrl+j alongside it for terminals that will not report the first.
//
// The cursor is the terminal's own, not a drawn one, so the placeholder and
// the real caret never disagree about where typing will land.

// that did not fit. The width is fixed either way, so the text still lines up
