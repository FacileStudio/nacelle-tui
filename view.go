// View draws only what is still changing: whatever a run is streaming right
// now, one status line, any queued messages, the dropdown menu when it has
// something to show, and the prompt. Everything finished has already been
// printed and belongs to the terminal.
//
// There is no alternate screen and no mouse mode, and dropping both is the
// point rather than an omission. An alt-screen program is handed a blank page
// with no scrollback of its own, so it has to own scrolling, which means
// capturing the wheel, which means taking click-drag selection too, which
// means tmux's copy-mode reaches nothing and quitting un-draws the whole
// session. Every one of those was reported here as its own separate
// complaint, and every one of them is the same decision. Giving the page back
// answers all of them at once: the terminal scrolls, selects, searches and
// keeps the session, because the session is ordinary terminal output again.
//
// What it costs is reflow. A printed line is the terminal's, so a resize
// rewraps it the way the terminal rewraps everything else rather than the way
// this client would have. That is the trade every other tool in the terminal
// already makes, including the shell this was launched from.
//
// The blank row above the status line is deliberate. Everything finished has
// been printed already, so without it the status sits hard against the last
// line of the answer and reads as part of it — a token count apparently
// belonging to the sentence above. One empty row is what separates the client
// talking about the run from the run's own output.
//
// The one thing recorded on the way out is how tall the frame came to be.
// Nothing else knows: layout works out what the frame is allowed to be, which
// is a different number the moment the live region is not full, and it runs
// before its own frame reaches the screen. Printing needs the frame that is
// actually up there, so this is where it is taken — see screen and printed.
//
// The cursor is positioned by hand because the prompt renders inside a larger
// frame: the component reports where its cursor sits within itself, and only
// the caller knows how many rows are above it. above is exactly those rows —
// computed once and reused for both the body and the cursor offset, so the
// two can never disagree about how tall the menu drew this frame.

// absorb folds one event into what is on screen.
//
// Text accumulates into the answer being streamed rather than becoming a line
// of its own: the deltas arrive a few characters at a time, and a transcript
// of those is unreadable.
//
// Reasoning accumulates separately. It is not part of the answer: the two
// written into one buffer come out concatenated with no separator, and that
// concatenation is what would go back as the assistant's message on every
// later turn, putting a chain of thought in the one field no provider wants it
// replayed in.
//
// A tool call says nothing here. Its line is built and held against the call
// id, and finished is what says it once the result names how long it took —
// see toolline.go for why the duration cannot be added to a line that has
// already been printed.
//
// The two events that are not reasoning stop the thinking clock on their way
// past, because this is where a turn stops thinking and starts doing. See
// thought for what measuring it anywhere later billed to thinking instead.
