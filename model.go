// not reach its next command until the one before it is done, so a line said
// on the way into a wait was not drawn until that wait ended. The question
// appeared when the answer did rather than when it was asked, and a tool's
// call line waited on the tool it announced: six seconds late for a
// six-second command, measured. Nothing already said is worth less than the
// thing it is waiting for. Fixing it here rather than in those two commands
// is the point — a third would arrive with no reason to know it had to flush
// first, which is how the second sat there while the first was being fixed.
//
// Two statements, not one call: as arguments they are evaluated left to right,
// which would drain the queue before the message that fills it was routed.
//
// Sequence, not Batch: a batch makes no promise about the order its commands
// run in, and the routed cmd may be tea.Quit — a quit that wins that race
// takes the last thing said with it, which for a queued /quit is the echo of

// key handles this client's bindings, reporting whether it consumed the
// press. Anything the scroller does not claim belongs to the prompt.
//
// Ctrl+C cancels a run in flight and only quits when nothing is running, so
// a long answer can be abandoned without losing the session — the terminal
// is in raw mode, so nothing quits on Ctrl+C unless this says so. That needs
// an escape hatch: busy only clears once settle sees the results channel
// close, and a tool wedged on a subprocess never closes it. A second ctrl+c
// inside forceQuit, or ctrl+\ at any time, quits regardless — otherwise the
// only way out of an alt-screen raw-mode terminal is kill -9 from elsewhere.
//
// Both stay live while a tool approval is pending too: a question nobody
// answers must not be a second way to get stuck. See decide's doc comment
// for why cancelling clears run.pending directly instead.
//
// The dropdown menu is checked next, ahead of both enter and the scroller:
// while it's open, up/down/tab/enter/esc belong to picking a command, not
// to scrolling the transcript or sending what's typed. Anything the menu
// itself does not claim (an ordinary character, backspace) falls all the
// way through to the prompt, which is what keeps its own filter editable.
//
// Ctrl+t sits above esc and takes the press unconditionally — see reveal for
// what it does with nothing to expand, and why that is not the call escaped
// makes. Esc reports an idle press unhandled because esc is the key every
// terminal reader uses to back out of something; nobody presses ctrl+t at a
// prompt meaning anything at all.
//
// Nobody except the textarea, which binds it to transpose-character-backward
// and now never sees it. That is the trade taken knowingly: transposing the
// two characters behind the cursor is an emacs habit almost nothing in this
// prompt is edited by, and reading the model's reasoning is a thing somebody
// wants several times a session.
//
// Esc stops a run and does nothing else, which is the whole reason it is
// worth having next to a ctrl+c that already cancels: the key that stops the
// answer is then never the key that might close the client, so there is no
// press that has to be thought about first. It sits below the menu on
// purpose — esc closes the dropdown before it stops anything, because a
// dropdown standing open is the nearer thing to back out of, and it is what
// esc already meant there. See escaped for what it does with no run to stop.
