// clear starts a new session in the same client: the conversation sent to
// the model and the running cost total are both reset. Nothing about the
// process restarts, which is the whole point of it being a command rather
// than a reason to quit and relaunch.
//
// It clears the screen rather than the history, and the difference is the
// point. What was said is in the terminal's scrollback and is not this
// client's to delete — the same reason no shell's own clear erases what came
// before it. Scroll back and the old session is still there, which is what
// somebody who cleared the wrong window will want.
//
// The screen is cleared by scrolling it away, not by tea.ClearScreen, which
// did nothing here and is why this command appeared to reset the session
// without resetting the window. bubbletea's inline renderer owns only the few
// rows it draws, so its clearScreen erases that frame's own cell buffer and
// never touches the transcript printed above it. Blank lines pushed through
// the same insertAbove path every printed line already takes do reach the
// terminal — and they scroll the old session up into the scrollback rather
// than erasing it, which is the behaviour above, kept by accident of being
// the only one available.
//
// This is the only command that prints from its own Cmd rather than by saying
// something, which is why it drains the queue by hand at both ends. Update
// prints what was said before it runs what the message started, which is right
// everywhere else and exactly wrong here: the echoed "/clear" has to go up
// before the blank run and the fresh banner has to go up after it. Left to the
// one drain, a clear either leaves the old prompt standing on the new screen or
// scrolls away the only line saying the session restarted.
//
// The banner is re-said rather than left gone: it is the only place the
// backend and model are ever named, and it is what makes the fresh screen
// legible as a fresh session rather than as a client that lost its place.
//
// The reported plan goes with the conversation it belonged to. Left standing,
// it is a list of steps from a session the model no longer remembers, so
// nothing it does afterwards will ever overwrite it — a plan that outlives its
// own run is not stale state, it is a lie about what is happening now. The
// field is assigned rather than passed through recordTasks, which re-arms the
// watcher on the way out and would leave a second goroutine on the reports
// channel every time somebody cleared. Re-laying out is not optional either:
// resize.go:105 reserves one screen row per line the plan draws, so dropping
// the plan without recomputing the layout leaves the live region short by
// however many rows the plan held, for the rest of the session.
